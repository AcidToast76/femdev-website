# FemDevs Homepage

This is the codebase for the official FemDevs homepage. It is built in Node.js using the Express framework.
Frontend code is writen in Pug.js and TailwindCSS.
API uses many free APIs provided by [Free APIs](https://free-apis.github.io/).

## How To Run

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Then, you can run the following commands to start the server:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
node .
```

The Webpage will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. (Note; CDNs, assets, and APIs are automatically setup to pull from the official server (`SUBDOMAIN.thefemdevs.com`), and therefore will not work regualarly on localhost. You will need to make additional modifications to the code to be able to access said resources locally.)
