          .text-gray-700.mb-4
            p.
              Hello! My name is Benjamin! I am a full stack developer who works on many applications.
              I am the owner of The FemDevs, a community of developers who are passionate about technology.
          h2(class='text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800') Upbringing
          .text-gray-700.mb-4
            p.
              I am a completely self-taught full stack developer. Ever sense I was a child, I have had a passion for technology.
              I have always been interested in how things work and how to make them better.
            p.
              At 5, I was using a computer at a proficient level. By 7, I was fixing technical issues with TVs and more.
              At 10, I was programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. That was my first real introduction to the world of software and web development.
            p.
              From there, I have honed my skills in Javascript/Typescript, both client-side and server-side. I am experienced in Pug.js, and Node.js.
              I have also worked with databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
            p.
              Outside of web development, I have experience in Python, Java, C++, Rust, and much, much more.
              I believe in the importance of having code bases be open source,
              so almost every project I work on is open source and accessible to the public on GitHub.
