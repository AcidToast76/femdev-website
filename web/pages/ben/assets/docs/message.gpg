Hello Everyone.
If you are reading this, well then, I don't know what to say...

Over the past few years, I have went from being extroverted and bery sociable to becoming crazy introverted. Everything happened so rapidly, and it was all brought on by a bunch of repeated harassment against me. I suffer from mental issues including anxiety, and because of the nature and the content within the content sent to me, it ultimately lead to me having self confidance issues. I feel ugly, both on the inside and the outside. I have been unable to show an accurate represtation of myself in years, and end up just putting on a facade for everyone around. It has become so long since I showed how I truely feel that ultimately, I am truely unable to distinguish fact from facade when it comes down to who I am as a person. I end up adjusting my personality on a per-person basis, so even between people, theres a lot of disparities. Externally, I feel like I am completely unattractive. I deal with constant and persistant acne which, no matter what I do, does not ever seem to leave me alone. I also lack physical strength and am not really muscular in any compacity. I am practicly skin and bones everything seems to further this vicious cycle I have brought upon myself. In addition to all of that, I am suffering physically from asthma and POTS. Personality-wise, I am dense, inmature, clingy, depressive, dry, unfunny, and just in general, not an intresting person. I try to push myself to make friends whenever possible, but ultimately, I bring nothing good to the table and in the end, lack any impressive features. I enjoy singing even though my ass does not sound good singing. I also don't know at all when to shut up. Mentally, I am lazy, depressing, and a energy-pit that seems to only serve to remove energy and joy from others. I feel like I would be better off if I just wasn't alive so fucking often, yet everytime I think about attempting, I always end up chickening out. I know a lot of people whould like to say that I am a good friend, yet I fail to see it myself.

In the end, I am considering quitting social media as a whole, which includes comunication platforms such as Discord. I am not deadset on leaving the platform quite yet, but in the future, I may end up leaving for good. Because of this, I wanna give a round-up of "thank you"-s to some people who have made a positive impact on my life.

To my good friend Alex,
Thank you for all the support you have provided me throughout the past about one and a half years. Through thick and thin, you still ended up sticking by my side and helping me through some of the darkest periods of my life. You don't realize truely how much you mean to me, and I am truely greatful for everything you have done for me and for numberous others. I wish you the best, and please, for the sake of me and many others, please don't take your life. You are worth way more than you realize, and even through all the hardships you have suffered, you shouldn't let that break you down to a point where you feel the only rational solution is to take your life.

To my dear friend Ollie,
I know we don't talk much anymore, but perviously, we had talked on a near-daily basis. Whether it be playing Genshin or playing Colourful Stage, I always enjoyed my time talking and interacting with you. I know I can be a bit overbearing a bit when it comes down to your history of mental health issues, but I just want to clarify that I was trying to help, and I now know that that's not an area I am good at. I know at times, you feel like no one cares about you or no one wants you around, but that couldn't be further from the truth, and I speak from personal knowladge. Never once throughout the time that I've known you can I remember a time where I truely was mad or annoyed with you, and that's something I can't say about the overwhelming majority of my friends. I just have one request of you and that is if possible, that you keep yourself safe and alive. I don't want you hurting yourself any more than you have already.

To my close friends Makii and Shiroo,
The majority of this message qualifies for the both of you so I thought I'd group you two together and just append on a shorter section for each one of you to provide further graditude. Man, where would I be without the two of you. You both cared and supported me through the past year and some. You both accepted me relatively quickly and because of that, you provided me a safe space to grow and develop myself. Without you, I wouldn't have likely made friends with people like Ollie and Avery. Makii, I want to thank you for the humor and support you have provided me during my time with the friend group. Shiroo, I wanna give a special thank you for everything you have done for everyone. Without you, I don't know what I would have done. You have quite literally spent weeks worth of time in vc with me and many others. Whether it was that one time we were in vc together for the 32 hours, or what not, you have always been extremely accomidating to me and others. Even when having to deal with my emotions and the numberous times I developed feeling, you never let that interfere with our friendship. I wish you the best in the future, and hope you can finally find a good partner, because I swear to fucking god, you have the worst luck when it comes down to men. 

To Kayden and Nezha,
Seeing as I got you two together, I feel its only fitting that I group you two together here. I want to thank you both for your constant care during good and bad. You always were there to help me out when I needed it most, and that is something that I can not show the true depth of graditude I have for you guys. I am glad you two got together and that you two seem to still be going strong. I wish you both the best in your futures. I would write more, but its 1:04 in the morning, and I'm running on fumes. Just know that theres a lot more that I want to say, but because of contributing factors, I am just unable to right now.

To everyone else,
There are so many others that have helped me throughout my life; so many that I am unable to properly thank each and every last one of them, and for those who are part of that group, this is for you. I know that I regularly make jokes that are horrible and just down right shitty. Even through that, you still decided to help me through everything, and I can not show how much that means to me through words. In general, I want to send out a huge thank you for everything you guys have done for me. I wouldn't have made it as far as I did without that.

Again, this may not be a final goodbye, but it is a thank you. Over the next few days to weeks, and possibly months, I will likely be less active if active at all. Chances are, I will update my information should I decide to leave for good. For those of you who have my email and/or phone number, I will still have access to that, and you can feel free to reach out to me through that, I will ask though that you dont release any of that information to anyone who doesn't already have it. Email-wise, if you really care to email me that badly, I have it available in so many locations, that you just need to start to look to find it.

Signed,
Benjamin
